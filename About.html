            Welcome to <strong>College MarketPlace</strong>, your one-stop platform for buying and selling used items within your college community!

            <h2 style="color:#ff6f00">Why Did I Built This?</h2><br>
            <p>
                I noticed that many students struggle to find affordable books, gadgets, and essentials.  
                At the same time, students often have items they no longer need but find it hard to sell.  
                This platform solves both problems by connecting students to buy and sell easily!
            </p>
